#CVE Assignment is it a vulnerability?

When it comes to security related issues some are clearly security problems such as remote code execution, some are clearly not (like adding a hardening for an already secure function) and some fall into a grey area of “maybe”. 

#Things that are almost always vulnerabilities:

##Does it have a CWE? 

Things that fall under the CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) and are exploitable (e.g. it is not in a dead code path) are clearly vulnerabilities. Please note that the CWE is by no means complete, so just because it is not listed here does not mean it isbn't a vulnerability.

##Does it have a CVSS score? 

If something is exploitable then it can typically have a CVSS score assigned to it. Typically a vulnerability results in an impact to the Confidentiality, Integrity or Available of a component or a system.

##Does it result in information leakage?

Some vulnerabilities result in a leakage of information, for example a vulnerability in a web app that allows usernames to be enumerated based on the error received when trying to reset a password (e.g. “user doesn't exist” vs. “password reset sent”). Some side channel attacks can result in a very limited amount of information being leaked, but as we have learned many of these attacks can be repeated in order to expose useful information.

##Does it violate stated security policy?

In this case if a system has a stated security policy like “encryption keys are generated using 160 bits of entropy” but in fact only uses 128 bits this would get a CVE despite the fact that 128 bit is generally considered secure. A system must correctly enforce its stated security policy. 

##Does the vulnerability violate an arbitrary rule?

Some classes of CVE are based on the fact that certain technologies or security mechanisms must be used. For example single DES is no longer considered secure, the 56 bit keys can now be factored on a modern machine in minutes or less. As such any use of DES (and export grade ciphers in general) would be considered CVE worthy. Other examples include web applications that use HTTP cookies for authentication and do not set the “httponly” flag on them (as it is assumed an XSS may be present that can be used to steal the cookie).  

##Does the vulnerability result in a denial of service?

Some flaws are clearly a denial of service vulnerability such as the “ping of death” (an oversized ICMP packet that caused operating systems to crash when they tried to reply to it). Others are more grey, for example when a connection results in memory being allocated and no limits are placed on how many connections can be made is most likely not going to be classified as a vulnerability and receive a CVE unless another factor is present to make it more exploitable such as holding the connection open for a long period with no timeout (such as the Slowloris attack or SYN Flooding). 

#Things that are almost never vulnerabilities:

##Hardening

Related to the example in “Does it violate stated security policy?” if a certificate creation tool makes no claims about how much entropy it uses, and is updated to use 160 bits instead of 128 bits of entropy this would be classed as a security hardening issue and would not need a CVE as the original behavior (using 128 bits of entropy) is currently accepted as a secure behavior.
