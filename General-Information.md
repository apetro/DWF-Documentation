## Contacting the DWF Project ##

The best way to contact us for public issues is to submit a Github issue against the appropriate DWF Project. This has the advantage of being public and allowing multiple members, and for the public to participate in and discuss the issue.

You can also email the DWF Project at distributedweaknessfiling@gmail.com (currently managed by Kurt Seifried). For private issues or concerns, please email us.
