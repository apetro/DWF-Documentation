# Distributed Weakness Filing (DWF) Project

The Distributed Weakness Filing (DWF) Project is the first federated CVE Number Authority (CNA). The DWF will initially deal with assigning CVEs for Open Source software (as defined by OSI approved Open Source licenses https://opensource.org/licenses and similar licenses). The DWF will assign CVEs for valid security vulnerabilities using the same or very similar processes as Mitre and other CVE Numbering Authorities currently use. 

## Getting a CVE Identifier from the DWF for your security vulnerability(s)

We are currently deciding on process for this, in the mean time you can submit an issue via the form at https://iwantacve.org/

## Becoming an Open Source CVE Numbering Authority

We are currently deciding on process for this, in the mean time you can file an issue against the DWF DNA Registry, or email cve-assign@seifried.org so we don't lose track of your CNA request.
