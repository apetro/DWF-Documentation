This is the universal CVE assignment HOWTO for the DWF (Distributed Weakness Filing project) CNA and the CNAs (CVE Numbering Authorities) within the DWF. This document applies to CVE requests for a single or multiple issues. This document is mandatory for DWF issued CVEs and strongly suggested for CNAs under the DWF. If you are unsure at any step please ask the requestor for more information or contact your parent CNA for help.

#Step 1: Is the CVE request for something your CNA is responsible for?

The DWF does Open Source unless there is a more specific vendor for the application (e.g. Debian, Red Hat) in which case the CVE request should be routed to that CNA. As a rule the DWF handles Open Source CVE assignments, and in the case of dual-license vendors (Open Source and closed source) may handle assignments for closed source software. If the CVE request is for something your CNA covers go to step 2. 

#Step 2: Is it a vulnerability? 

Is a trust boundary crossed (what does that even mean)? Is there privilege escalation? Remote access? Information disclosure? Denial of Service? Does it cross an arbitrary rule like “web applications must use httponly on cookies”? Does it violate the stated security policy for the system or application? Typically a vulnerability will map to a CWE identifier, but not always. If it is a vulnerability go to step 3.

#Step 3: Confirm report/artifacts

Confirm the report and artifacts (if available). Depending on the trust level with the requestor this can be highly involved or completely trust based. A solid rule of thumb is how many correct CVE requests have they made in the past. Please note that trust data will be added to the DNA (DWF Numbering Authority) registry as time goes on. Once confirmed (or assuming they are highly trusted) go to step 4.

#Step 4: SPLIT/MERGE the vulnerabilities

If you have only a single vulnerability simply assign it a CVE. If you have multiple vulnerabilities being reported you will need to SPLIT/MERGE them so CVEs can be properly assigned. Please remember CVE is a pragmatic standard, although it would be “correct” to assign each instance of a vulnerability it’s own CVE it wouldn’t be practical or add much value (since people tend to fix things at once rather then dribble out fixes). Group the vulnerabilities by codebase, vulnerability type (e.g. CWE), version affected and the reporter (researcher or organization) in the case of multiple reporters reporting similar vulns at the same time. Ideally each group of CVEs should have a unique codebase, vulnerability, the same affected version and be from the same researcher(s). Once you have everything sorted out proceed to step 5.

#Step 5: Assign CVE in DWF Database as RESERVED

The DWF uses a two stage commit process, we first mark the CVE as reserved, we then add the details later (if available). It is advised that other CNAs use a similar process as it makes handling embargoes simpler. If the CVE is public please proceed to step 6a and 6b. If the CVE is embargoed please proceed to step 7.

#Step 6: Create artifacts in Artifacts DB and update CVE in DWF database as PUBLIC

If the data for this CVE is public we can add the artifacts in the artifact database and create the JSON file entry. Additionally the title, typically a copy of the description can be added to the CVE Database and the entry can be marked as PUBLIC. Please proceed to step 7 and notify the requestor that the CVE has been made public.

#Step 7: Provide CVE feedback to requestor

Once the CVE is assigned it must be communicated back to the original requestor. If you are a CNA within the DWF CNA hierarchy you must also report the CVE “upstream” to the DWF. 

# Some notes

The majority of this process will be automated via well formed submissions, tools to accept and store artifacts, and tooling to assign the CVE and update the relevant databases as needed and then notify the CVE requestor. Please note at this time we have not deployed the technology and as such are still mostly using a manual process.
